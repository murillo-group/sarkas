This function assumes a white background if you are running a Jupyter notebook, while a dark background in the case of an IPython/Python kernel.\n",

    "Next Sarkas prints the path where the snapshots (`dumps`) and the thermodynamics information of the simulation will be stored. Notice that these are in a directory called `Simulations/yocp_ppm/PreProcessing`. The actual simulation's dumps and energy files will be in a different directory, see next [page](./Simulation_Docs.ipynb). \n",

    "### PARTICLES\n",
    "In this section we can find info about the particles we are simulating. Importantly we find the physical constants like the plasma frequency and Debye length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SIMULATION BOX\n",
    "Next we have info on the simulation box with relevant lengths and parameters. These include the value of the Wigner-Seitz radius, ``a_ws``, the number of non zero dimensions, and the length of the simulation box sides in terms of ``a_ws`` and its numerical value in the chosen units. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ELECTRON PROPERTIES\n",
    "This section prints thermodynamics quantities as well as dimensionless parameters of the surrounding electron liquid. Here we find the Thomas-Fermi length which is used for the screening parameter $\\kappa$ of our Yukawa potential. Formulas for the calculation of each of these quantities can be found in the Electron Properties [page](../../theory/electron_properties.rst) in the Theoretical Background section.\n",

    "The last line prints the coupling parameter as defined [here](../../theory/coupling_constant.rst)\n",

    "This section prints information about the choice of our algorithm. Sarkas uses a generalized P3M (or PPPM) algortihm to handle medium to long range interactions. More info can be found in our page on [PPPM](../../theory/PPPM.rst) and DSGM17 in [References](../../theory/references.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts in this algorithm: particle-particle (PP) and particle-mesh (PM). The former consists of a Linked-Cell-List (LCL). The PM instead consists in depositing the charges on a mesh, move to Fourier space, solve Poisson equation on the mesh and get the electric field, inverse Fourier to return to real space, and finally use the Electric field to push the particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such this algorithm requires nine parameters: the charge assignment order ``Potential.pppm_cao``, the number of aliases of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) per direction, ``Potential.pppm_aliases``, the Ewald screening parameter `Potential.pppm_alpha_ewald`, the number of mesh points per direction ``Potential.pppm_mesh``, and the short-range cut-off `Potential.rc`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Beside the choice of parameters Sarkas outputs the most relevant information for this algorithm: the number of cells per dimension for the LCL algorithm, the number of particles in the LCL loops, number of neighbors per particle, and the error in the force calculation. This is the error due to our choice of parameters. For more details on the way this is calculated see the page [Force Error](../../theory/force_error.rst). This number is dimensionless since all the variable have been rescaled.\n",
    "There is no _good_ value for the Force error and it is up to YOU to decide. In Non-Ideal plasmas it is usually chosen to be less than ``1e-5``. In this case we have `Tot Force Error = 6.442673e-06`. \n",

    "### THERMOSTAT\n",
    "Next we find information about the thermostat used. At the moment Sarkas supports the Berendsen thermostat only. You can learn more about it on this [page](../Features_files/Berendsen_NB/Berendsen_Thermostat.ipynb).\n",
    "The parameter `relaxation_timestep` tells us the timestep number at which the thermostat will be turned on. Before then the system will evolve at constant energy. A good number for this is the timestep equivalent to 1 or 2 plasma periods as this allows the system to convert most of its potential energy into kinetic energy and thus reaching its maximum value. Turning on the thermostat once the kinetic energy is maximal is the most efficient way to thermalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a Warning message. This is because we did not define the equilibration `temperatures` (or `temperatures_eV`) in the `Thermostat` section of the YAML file. As the warning says, this is not a problem as Sarkas will use the temperatures defined in the `Particles` section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### INTEGRATOR\n",
    "The last section prints out info about our choice of Integrator and about the timing of the phases of our simulation. The most important parameters here are the `Total plasma frequency` and `w_p dt`. The total plasma frequency is calculated from \n",

    "where $\\omega_i$ is the plasma frequency of species $i$. In the case of a one component plasma, as in this case, the total plasma frequency is the same as the plasma frequency printed in the `PARTICLES` section above.\n",
    "The number `w_p dt` tells us the fraction of plasma periods that corresponds to our choice of `dt`. A non-written rule among researchers says that we should choose a `dt` such that $\\omega_p dt < 1/ 25$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization Times\n",
    "In this section are indicated the times for the initialization part of the simulation. These times are\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Potential Initialization` where the all the potential parameters, including the Optimal Green's function in the case of PPPM algorithm, are calculated.\n",
    "- `Particles Initialization` where the particles positions and velocities are initialized. This includes the case where a specific particles distribution is chosen.\n",

    "### Radial Distribution Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common physical observable is the Radial Distribution Function (RDF). Our choice of `Parameters.rdf_nbins : 500` and `Potential.rc : 6.2702e-11` leads to `dr = 0.0110 a_ws` and `r_max = 5.5100 a_ws`. If we desire to have a larger `r_max` we will need to increase `potential.rc`. As mentioned above this might lead to an inefficient force calculation, but the force error plots can help us find an optimal `alpha` for a larger `rcut`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Structure Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform of the RDF leads to the Static Structure Factor (SSF). The important parameters for the SSF is the desired range of wavevectors to calculate. The output shows the chosen number of harmonics of the smallest wavevector in each of cartesian directions. These are the same values in the YAML file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we find the total number of $\\mathbf k$ (vectors) that will be calculated. This number corresponds to the total number of combinations of the three harmonics directions, `n_x * n_y * n_z - 1` .\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest $\\mathbf k$ vector that can be fitted int the simulation box is given by the length of the longest side of the simulation box, $L$. This is computed from the total number of particles, $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k_{\\rm min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\approx \\frac{3.9}{N^{1/3}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $k_{\\rm min} a_{\\rm ws} = 0.1809 $, if we need to investigate smaller wavevectors we need to increase the number of particles. The above equation can be used to find the value of $N$ for the desired $k_{\\rm min}$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest wavevector, instead, is defined by our choice of `angle_averaging`. This parameter can take three values `principal_axis`, `custom`, `full`. The default value for this parameter is `principal_axis`. More about this parameter will be explained in the [Post Processing notebook](./Post_Processing_Docs.ipynb). For the moment we mention that in the case of `angle_averaging = principal_axis` the maximum value is calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k_{\\rm max} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{L} \\sqrt{3} n_x, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "while in the case `angle_averaging = full` as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k_{\\rm max} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{L} \\sqrt{n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Structure Factor and Current Correlation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "These two functions depend on the same parameters. However, it can be the case that only one of the two is calculated, hence, a section for each of them. The parameters are divided in two sections, frequency and wavevector constants. The wavevectors constants are the same as those in SSF. This is due to the fact that the $\\mathbf k$ data is saved once computed the first time. Any subsequent calculation requiring this data will read in the saved data and not recompute it. Therefore it is important to check that the parameters in the YAML file are the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "As per the frequency constants, the first parameters is the number of slices. This indicates the number in which to divide the timeseries data. A DSF (or CCF) will be calculated for each slice and the final result will be an average over all the slices. The important parameters are then the frequency step and the maximum frequency calculated from the FFT. For each of these values, the corresponding equation is given so to help the user decide the correct parameters.\n",
    "The maximum frequency is given by \n",
    " \n",
    "$$ \\omega_{\\rm max} = \\frac{\\pi}{d_s \\Delta t } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Delta t$ is the timestep and $d_s$ the snapshot interval (`prod_dump_step`). The frequency step instead is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\frac{d_s N_s}{M_T \\Delta t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_s$ is the number of slices (`no_slices`), $M_T$ the number of timesteps (`production_steps`)."

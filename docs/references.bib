	abstract = {In the collective mode spectrum of a relativistic, strongly coupled plasma, novel physical effects emerge, which are absent both in the weakly coupled relativistic and in the strongly coupled non-relativistic plasmas. Inspired by the pseudo-relativistic behavior of the electron gas in two-dimensional graphene layers, we address the problem of a classical two-dimensional, ultrarelativistic system of charged particles. We investigate the mode dispersion and damping both through molecular dynamics simulations and analytically via the quasi-localized charge approximation and develop modiﬁcations of the theory appropriate for this system. The new aspect introduced in the simulation is the decoupling of particle velocities from the particle momenta. As for new physical features, their origin is to be sought in the constancy of particle speeds and in the broad distribution of ‘plasma frequencies’, mimicking the similar distribution of momenta is causing the system to emulate the behavior of a collection of an inﬁnite number of oscillators. Of particular interest is the strongly reduced damping at weak coupling, brought about by the disappearance of the Landau damping and the greatly enhanced damping at strong coupling, caused by the phase mixing of the coupled plasma oscillators. We suggest the possible experimental detection of these effects in graphene.},

abstract = {The temperature equilibration rate between electrons and protons in dense hydrogen has been calculated with molecular dynamics simulations for temperatures between 10 and 600 eV and densities between 1020 cm-3 to 1024 cm-3. Careful attention has been devoted to convergence of the simulations, including the role of semiclassical potentials. We find that for Coulomb logarithms L 1, a model by Gericke-Murillo-Schlanges (GMS) based on a T -matrix method and the approach by Brown-Preston-Singleton agrees with the simulation data to within the error bars of the simulation. For smaller Coulomb logarithms, the GMS model is consistent with the simulation results. Landau-Spitzer models are consistent with the simulation data for L{\textgreater}4. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Hansen1981,
abstract = {Results of "molecular dynamics" simulations are reported for a model of a fully ionized strongly coupled hydrogen plasma. Quantum effects are taken into account through the use of effective pair potentials; at short distances, these differ significantly from the bare Coulomb potential. Static properties of the plasma are shown to be well described by hypernetted chain theory. The ion- and electron-velocity autocorrelation functions have been computed and the electrical conductivity turns out to be roughly twice that expected on the basis of the electron self-diffusion coefficient. The predictions of Vlasov theory for the damping and dispersion of the plasmon mode are found to be in generally poor agreement with the results of the computer "experiments", but the collective dynamical properties are successfully described by a memory-function scheme in which explicit account is taken of ion-electron correlations. Prospects for future work are briefly reviewed. {\textcopyright} 1981 The American Physical Society.},
